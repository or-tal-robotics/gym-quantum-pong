# experiments protocols:
1. [c00 + c01 + c10 - c11], Where the left player have full controll over the entaglement (theta_ent)
2. [c00 + c01 + c10 - c11], Where the left player have no controll over the entaglement (theta_ent = pi/4)
3. [c00 + c01 + c10 - c11], Where the left player have no controll over the entaglement (theta_ent = pi/6)
4. [c00 + c01 + c10 - c11], Where the left player have no controll over the entaglement (theta_ent = 0)
